      "Both Observation 1 and Observations 2 The following information relates to questions 30-34 Elena Vasileva recently joined EnergyInvest as a junior portfolio analyst. Vasile- va’s supervisor asks her to evaluate a potential investment opportunity in Amtex, a multinational oil and gas corporation based in the United States. Vasileva’s supervisor suggests using regression analysis to examine the relation between Amtex shares and returns on crude oil. Vasileva notes the following assumptions of regression analysis: ■ Assumption 1. The error term is uncorrelated across observations. ■ Assumption 2. The variance of the error term is the same for all observations. ■ Assumption 3. The dependent variable is normally distributed. Vasileva runs a regression of Amtex share returns on crude oil returns using the monthly data she collected. Selected data used in the regression are presented in Exhibit 1, and selected regression output is presented in Exhibit 2. She uses a 1 percent level of significance in all her tests. Exhibit 1: Selected Data for Crude Oil Returns and Amtex Share Returns Oil Return (Xi) Amtex Return (Yi) Cross-Product ​(​X​ i​ − ​ _ X ​)​(​Y​ i​ − ​ _ Y ​)​ Predicted Amtex Return (​ ˆ Y ​ i​) Regression Residual (​Y​ i​ − ​ ˆ Y ​ i​) Squared Residual ​(​Y​ i​ − ​ ˆ Y ​ i​)​ 2​ Month 1 −0.032000 0.033145 −0.000388 0.002011 −0.031134 0.000969 ⁝ ⁝ ⁝ ⁝ ⁝ ⁝ ⁝ Month 36 0.028636 0.062334 0.002663 0.016282 −0.046053 0.002121 Sum 0.085598 0.071475 Average −0.018056 0.005293 Exhibit 2: Selected Regression Output, Dependent Variable: Amtex Share Return Coefficient Standard Error Intercept 0.0095 0.0078 Oil return 0.2354 0.0760 Critical t-values for a 1 percent level of significance: One-sided, left side: −2.441 Simple Linear Regression One-sided, right side: +2.441 Two-sided: ±2.728 Vasileva expects the crude oil return next month, Month 37, to be −0.01.

Abitbol looks at economists’ inflation forecasts and would like to examine the Simple Linear Regression relationship between the US Consumer Price Index (US CPI) consensus forecast and the actual US CPI using regression analysis.

One of the world’s largest companies, Stellar is in the business of refining and marketing oil. As part of his analysis, Golub wants to evaluate the sensitivity of the stock’s returns to various economic factors. For example, a client recently asked Golub whether the price of Stellar Energy Corp. stock has tended to rise following increases in retail energy prices. Golub believes the association between the two variables is negative, but he does not know the strength of the association. Golub directs his assistant, Jill Batten, to study the relationships between (1) Stel- lar monthly common stock returns and the previous month’s percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index for Energy (CPIENG) and (2) Stellar monthly common stock returns and the previous month’s percentage change in the US Producer Price Index for Crude Energy Materials (PPICEM). Golub wants Batten to run both a correlation and a linear regression analysis. In response, Batten compiles the summary statistics shown in Exhibit 1 for 248 months. All the data are in decimal form, where 0.01 indicates a 1 percent return. Batten also runs a regression analysis using Stellar monthly returns as the dependent variable and the monthly change in CPIENG as the independent variable. Exhibit 2 displays the results of this regression model.

Simple Linear Regression The following information relates to questions 9-12 Kenneth McCoin, CFA, is a challenging interviewer. Last year, he handed each job applicant a sheet of paper with the information in Exhibit 1, and he then asked several questions about regression analysis. Some of McCoin’s questions, along with a sample of the answers he received to each, are given below. McCoin told the applicants that the independent variable is the ratio of net income to sales for restaurants with a market cap of more than $100 million and the depen- dent variable is the ratio of cash flow from operations to sales for those restau- rants. Which of the choices provided is the best answer to each of McCoin’s questions?

The following information relates to questions 18-26 Anh Liu is an analyst researching whether a company’s debt burden affects inves- tors’ decision to short the company’s stock. She calculates the short interest ratio (the ratio of short interest to average daily share volume, expressed in days) for 50 companies as of the end of the year and compares this ratio with the companies’ debt ratio (the ratio of total liabilities to total assets, expressed in decimal form). Liu provides a number of statistics in Exhibit 1. She also estimates a simple regression to investigate the effect of the debt ratio on a company’s short inter- est ratio. The results of this simple regression, including the analysis of variance (ANOVA), are shown in Exhibit 2. In addition to estimating a regression equation, Liu graphs the 50 observations using a scatter plot, with the short interest ratio on the vertical axis and the debt ratio on the horizontal axis.

Interpretation 2 Companies’ higher short interest ratios cause higher debt ratios. Interpretation 3 Companies with higher debt ratios tend to have lower short interest ratios.
